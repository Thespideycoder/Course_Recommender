# **Course Recommendation System**
***
This project is about simple The Course Recommendation System which I've made using NeatText, CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer ...<br>
* NeatText is a simple Natural Language Processing package. I've used it for cleaning text data and pre-processing text data(Course_title).
* CountVectorizer is a tool of the scikit-learn library. It remove punctuation and lower the documents. It turns each vector into the sparse matrix. 
* TfidfVectorizer is the base building block of NLP pipelines. It is a simple technique to vectorize text documents
